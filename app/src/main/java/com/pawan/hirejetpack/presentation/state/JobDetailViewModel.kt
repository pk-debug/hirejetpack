/**
 * [JobDetailViewModel] — owns the state for a single job's detail screen:
 * the job itself, its application status, and its bookmark status.
 *
 * KEYWORD: [SavedStateHandle]
 * Automatically injected by `viewModel()` when this ViewModel is created
 * inside a `composable(...)` destination that declares a nav argument.
 * It's a key-value bag holding the current destination's arguments AND
 * survives process death (unlike a constructor parameter would), which is
 * exactly why we read `jobId` from here instead of passing it straight
 * into the ViewModel's constructor from the Composable.
 *
 * Staff note on bookmarks: this ViewModel does NOT own bookmark state —
 * [BookmarkRepository] does. Here, we just `collect` its
 * [BookmarkRepository.bookmarkedIds] flow inside `init` and mirror
 * whether THIS job's id is in that set into our own `_uiState`. That's
 * the pattern for "read shared state, expose it as part of a
 * screen-specific state class": collect the shared flow, don't copy its
 * value once and forget about it — collecting keeps this screen in sync
 * if the bookmark is toggled from the Home screen while this screen is
 * still open (e.g. after backgrounding and returning).

     * before recomposition disables the button — never rely on the UI
     * alone (like `enabled = false`) to make an action safe; the source
