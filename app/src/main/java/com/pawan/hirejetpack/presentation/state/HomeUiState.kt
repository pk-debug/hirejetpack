/**
 * [HomeUiState] — Single Source of Truth for the Home screen.
 *
 * Noob note: this is "everything the Home screen needs in order to draw
 * itself" bundled into one object.
 * Staff note: exposing this wrapper (instead of a bare
 * `StateFlow<List<Job>>`) means adding `error: String?` later doesn't
 * change the shape consumers collect — one state object, one collector,
 * no risk of `isLoading` and `jobs` updating on different frames.
